# Tastebytes

Tastebytes is a JavaScript React web application that utilizes React Router, Bootstrap 4 and Yelp API with Google Firebase to store user information.

1. Login Page
    - Users can signup for accounts manually or continue with Facebook. 

2. Home Page
    - Users can view any received recommendations from friends, along with their list of restaurant, presented as cards. Each card has the following: restaurant name, location, share option to friends, delete option to remove from list, friends' reviews, and an aggregate score. 

3. Friends Page
    - Users can send friend requests by receipent's email address. In addition, they can accept/deny any current friend requests. Accepted friends will populate the page as cards containing: their name, list and quantity of restaurants, add option to user's list, rate option to review a restaurant and the restaurant's location.
    
4. Search Page
    - Users must enable GPS in order to search for restaurants with Yelp API, by entering any search term. Search Results will populate after a search is completed and users can simply add any selection to their personal list.

In essence, Tastebytes allows users to create their own list of restaurants, cafes and more with Yelp, Share their lists with Friends and identify commonalities, Recommend locations to each other from your own list, and Rate and comment friends' lists to voice your opinion/experience.

It serves as a resource to visit locations based on personal connections instead of strangers. After all, would you take your friend's opinion over a stranger's? Food for thought.
