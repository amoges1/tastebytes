# Tastebytes

Tastebytes is a JavaScript React web application that utilizes Bootstrap 4 and Yelp API. User can:

1. Create their own list of restaurants, cafes and more with Yelp
2. Share their lists with Friends and identify commonalities 
3. Recommend locations to each other from your own list
4. Rate and comment friends' lists to voice your opinion/experience

In essence, it serves as a resource to visit locations based on personal connections instead of strangers. 

Would you take your friend's opinion over a stranger's? Food for thought.
